# SENSORS, ACTUATORS, INTERRUPTS & SERIAL COMMUNICATION USING 8051 MICROCONTROLLER

## Problem Statement

**A party hall has 4 fans and 4 lights, for every 50 secs 1 fans should get turned on and for next 50 secs 1 light should get turned on this should continue repeatedly. Upon occurrence of an interrupts transfer serially "PARTY".
Write 8051 microcontroller program to demonstrate the same.**
